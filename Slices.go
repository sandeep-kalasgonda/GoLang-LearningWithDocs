/* Slices are similar to arrays, but are more powerful and flexible.

Like arrays, slices are also used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

However, unlike arrays, the length of a slice can grow and shrink as you see fit.

In Go, there are several ways to create a slice:

Using the []datatype{values} format
Create a slice from an array
Using the make() function
*/

//SYNTAX slices_name := [lenght]datatype{values}
